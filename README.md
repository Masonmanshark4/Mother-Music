## Description

This is a simple music playlist generator using the the spotify node module and openweather API. The spotify node is able to connect to spotify services to pull music. Meanwhile the openweather API inputs the users latitude and longitude to determine the current weather and parse the data to the spotify node. Users can log in to their spotify accounts and save any of the used playlists to their personal library and remember their location.

This is a project made with the accummulative efforts of Kailee Segarra, Mason Carr, Ryan Lee, Stephanie Zolton. Following the end of week 14 of our bootcamp we have come to a crossroad of having to work both back end and front end development of a web page. The project is a real-world full-stack application meant to utilize node modules
